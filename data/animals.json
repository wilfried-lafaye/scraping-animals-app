They use their sharp front teeth to nibble on the tough ends of grasses before grinding them up using the flat molars along its cheeks. Because grass has little nutritional value, Zebras must spend between 60% and 80% of the day grazing. Common Zebras are often seen drinking at water holes daily. However, due to the fact that the Grevy’s Zebra and the Mountain Zebra inhabit drier, more arid regions, they often don’t drink for several days at a time. In the dry season, Zebras can travel vast distances in search of fresh grass and water holes that haven’t yet dried up, with the Grevy’s Zebra also known to dig into the ground of dried-up river beds to access the water underground.

Some are also found in close proximity to human settlements where they are known to have to compete with domestic livestock, such as Donkeys, for food. It is in these areas where Zonkeys are most likely to be produced naturally in the wild as it allows the two separate species to mate. Sadly, however, the world’s Zonkeys tend to be found in zoos and animal institutions where they are generally bred deliberately.",

The majority of their food is made up of grasses and herbs that grow on the ground and like all equines, the Zonkey has flat, broad teeth which are the perfect tools for grinding down the fibrous grass. Along with grazing, Zonkeys also like to browse for other types of food including fruits and berries which are found growing more common in less arid areas. Due to the fact that Zonkeys are naturally found in the African wilderness, there is always competition for both food and water from other animals inhabiting the same area and so they are always on the move in search of greener pastures.",

The Zorse primarily eats grasses, herbs and flowers that grow on ground level, along with leaves, fruits and berries that it has to pull from the trees or finds on the floor. Zorses generally will not eat plants that are poisonous, but are known to resort to eating plants that contain toxins when there is not an adequate supply of more nutritious food.

Although the exact population size is unknown, there are estimated to be between 200,000 and 250,000 individuals remaining in the freezing waters of the Arctic Circle.",
        "habitat": "Walruses are animals that are found throughout the northern Atlantic and Pacific Oceans where they inhabit ice floes and rocky coastlines, along with spending a great deal of time in the freezing cold water. During the winter months when the ice is at its thickest, Walruses tend to prefer areas of thinner ice that they can easily break through to the surface from the water underneath. In the warmer summer months when the ice recedes, Walruses can be found more commonly on remote areas of rocky coastline. Despite being well suited to the freezing conditions in the far north, Walruses have on occasion been known to venture further south in areas of Central Canada, around the United Kingdom, and even as far as the waters close to the Spanish coast. They do, however, spend most of their time in and around the Arctic Circle where they are becoming increasingly under threat from global warming which is rapidly depleting the ice that these animals have learned to rely on.",
        "diet": "Walruses are carnivorous animals that only hunt and eat other animals to survive. They have thick mustaches containing roughly 450 very sensitive whiskers that help them to find food in the dark and murky waters at depths of around 100 meters below the surface. Walruses find almost all of their prey on the ocean floor and are known to expel streams of both air and water into the sediment to reveal food hidden under the sand. They feed primarily by sucking food into their mouths rather than using their teeth to chew on it and are even known to grip shellfish between their lips and suck the soft creature out from inside the shell, before spitting the shell out into the water. Walruses feed on a variety of different prey species including clams,",

For most of the year, the Umbrellabird can be found inhabiting lowlands and mountain foothills, generally at altitudes less than 500 meters. During the breeding season however, they migrate higher into the mountains where the gather in groups known as a “Lek” where they can find a mate. These breeding sites are usually in cloud forests that are between 800-2,000 meters above sea level. The Umbrella bird is known as an altitudinal migrant as it migrates up and down the mountains rather than across the land.",

Fruits and small animals are the Umbrellabird’s primary sources of food. It eats a range of invertebrates such as insects and spiders, along with small frogs and birds. The Umbrellabird uses its strong toes to hold onto the branches while it picks fruits and berries with its curved beak. The quite long, black beak of the Umbrellabird is similar to that of a Raven and allows the Umbrellabird to snap up passing insects with ease. Since the Umbrellabird drops seeds from the fruit it eats across the forest, it plays a vital role in its native eco-system.",

The regulation of Black Bears is also well-managed and although between 40,000 and 50,000 individuals are killed every year (depleting up to 20% of the population in some areas), the general population trend is increasing.",

Today they are found in northern Canada, throughout western and parts of the eastern USA, and down into northern Mexico. Providing there is a forest habitat of some description these incredibly adaptable animals will try their best to survive successfully there and they are actually found in a number of very diverse regions. Black Bears are known to inhabit the hot and dry, shrubby forests of Mexico and the steamy, hardwood swamps of the south-eastern USA, right up to the coniferous forests of Canada and Alaska and the barren treeless tundra even further north. Despite local populations in some areas being affected by the loss of their natural habitats, the resilience of the Black Bear means that populations in most areas are actually increasing.",

Between 75% and 95% of their diet is vegetarian (depending on the food available in different locations) and it is also greatly varied. Black Bears forage for fruits and nuts in the trees which they pluck off the branches using their prehensile lips, along with eating grasses, roots, and bulbs on the ground and supplementing their diet with small animals like insects and rodents. Depending on the region and therefore the prey available, Black Bears are also known to hunt young Deer, eat carrion, and can also master the art of catching fish in rivers (a skill that is particularly used in areas where they are no Grizzly Bears to compete for food). Due to their large body size though, Black Bears must spend the vast majority of the night eating and will spend an average of 12 hours a day trying to build up their fat reserves for winter.",

Jaguars prefer a moist, dense, thick, jungle habitat with plenty of cover in order to successfully hunt and ambush prey.

        "diet": "The hippopotamus is a herbivorous animal, meaning that despite its enormously long and sharp teeth, they are vegetarians. Different species of grasses are the main source of food for the hippopotamus that is found growing on plains relatively close to water. When they come onto land at night, hippos may travel up to three miles during the night to get to their feeding grounds which they do by following paths that are marked with dung. Oddly enough, the hippopotamus doesn’t even use its large canines for eating at all but instead has strong lips that are used to clip the grasses and cheek teeth which then grind them up. Despite its large size, the hippopotamus only eats around 88 pounds of food a night as it uses very little energy whilst floating in the water for most of the day. In areas that are close to human settlements, hippos have also been known to invade crops consuming mainly rice plants and simply trampling over others.

Another adaptation for living in the desert is their split, leathery lip which helps the Camel to eat tough and thorny plants which other animals avoid. They are also known to consume plants that are high in salt which again means there is less competition from other animals for food. One of the most remarkable things about Camels is their ability to store the energy from their food and water as fat in their hump, which means they have a ready supply of energy when food and water are scarce. Camels can lose up to 40% of their body weight before needing to replenish themselves and once a water hole or oasis is found, they can drink around 40 gallons of water in a very short time.

They use their sharp front teeth to nibble on the tough ends of grasses before grinding them up using the flat molars along its cheeks. Because grass has little nutritional value, Zebras must spend between 60% and 80% of the day grazing. Common Zebras are often seen drinking at water holes daily. However, due to the fact that the Grevy’s Zebra and the Mountain Zebra inhabit drier, more arid regions, they often don’t drink for several days at a time.

Some are also found in close proximity to human settlements where they are known to have to compete with domestic livestock, such as Donkeys, for food. It is in these areas where Zonkeys are most likely to be produced naturally in the wild as it allows the two separate species to mate. Sadly, however, the world’s Zonkeys tend to be found in zoos and animal institutions where they are generally bred deliberately.",

Along with grazing, Zonkeys also like to browse for other types of food including fruits and berries which are found growing more common in less arid areas.

Although the exact population size is unknown, there are estimated to be between 200,000 and 250,000 individuals remaining in the freezing waters of the Arctic Circle.",

During the winter months when the ice is at its thickest, Walruses tend to prefer areas of thinner ice that they can easily break through to the surface from the water underneath. In the warmer summer months when the ice recedes, Walruses can be found more commonly on remote areas of rocky coastline. Despite being well suited to the freezing conditions in the far north, Walruses have on occasion been known to venture further south in areas of Central Canada, around the United Kingdom, and even as far as the waters close to the Spanish coast. They do, however, spend most of their time in and around the Arctic Circle where they are becoming increasingly under threat from global warming which is rapidly depleting the ice that these animals have learned to rely on.",

They have thick mustaches containing roughly 450 very sensitive whiskers that help them to find food in the dark and murky waters at depths of around 100 meters below the surface. Walruses find almost all of their prey on the ocean floor and are known to expel streams of both air and water into the sediment to reveal food hidden under the sand. They feed primarily by sucking food into their mouths rather than using their teeth to chew on it and are even known to grip shellfish between their lips and suck the soft creature out from inside the shell, before spitting the shell out into the water. Walruses feed on a variety of different prey species including clams,",

During the breeding season however, they migrate higher into the mountains where the gather in groups known as a “Lek” where they can find a mate. These breeding sites are usually in cloud forests that are between 800-2,000 meters above sea level. The Umbrella bird is known as an altitudinal migrant as it migrates up and down the mountains rather than across the land.",

Fruits and small animals are the Umbrellabird’s primary sources of food. It eats a range of invertebrates such as insects and spiders, along with small frogs and birds. The Umbrellabird uses its strong toes to hold onto the branches while it picks fruits and berries with its curved beak. The quite long, black beak of the Umbrellabird is similar to that of a Raven and allows the Umbrellabird to snap up passing insects with ease. Since the Umbrellabird drops seeds from the fruit it eats across the forest, it plays a vital role in its native eco-system.",

Although the Quokka mainly browses for food on the ground, they are also known to climb about a meter or so up into the trees, and also swallow their food without chewing it. The Quokka then regurgitates the undigested material in the form of a cud, which is also eaten. They have no need to drink vast amounts of water and are said to be able to go for months without drinking at all.",

The regulation of Black Bears is also well-managed and although between 40,000 and 50,000 individuals are killed every year (depleting up to 20% of the population in some areas), the general population trend is increasing.",

Today they are found in northern Canada, throughout western and parts of the eastern USA, and down into northern Mexico. Providing there is a forest habitat of some description these incredibly adaptable animals will try their best to survive successfully there and they are actually found in a number of very diverse regions. Black Bears are known to inhabit the hot and dry, shrubby forests of Mexico and the steamy, hardwood swamps of the south-eastern USA, right up to the coniferous forests of Canada and Alaska and the barren treeless tundra even further north. Despite local populations in some areas being affected by the loss of their natural habitats, the resilience of the Black Bear means that populations in most areas are actually increasing.",

Between 75% and 95% of their diet is vegetarian (depending on the food available in different locations) and it is also greatly varied. Black Bears forage for fruits and nuts in the trees which they pluck off the branches using their prehensile lips, along with eating grasses, roots, and bulbs on the ground and supplementing their diet with small animals like insects and rodents. Depending on the region and therefore the prey available, Black Bears are also known to hunt young Deer, eat carrion, and can also master the art of catching fish in rivers (a skill that is particularly used in areas where they are no Grizzly Bears to compete for food). Due to their large body size though, Black Bears must spend the vast majority of the night eating and will spend an average of 12 hours a day trying to build up their fat reserves for winter.",

Over the past 10 years, their populations have declined by 7-20%. However, the hippopotamus is still considered to be abundant throughout much of its current natural range, with the exception of populations in western Africa that are becoming more and more isolated. Although hippopotamus populations are considered stable in a number of countries in the south and the east of the continent, they are declining in many others. They are particularly threatened by continuing poaching of them for their tusks.",

        "diet": "The hippopotamus is a herbivorous animal, meaning that despite its enormously long and sharp teeth, they are vegetarians. Different species of grasses are the main source of food for the hippopotamus that is found growing on plains relatively close to water. When they come onto land at night, hippos may travel up to three miles during the night to get to their feeding grounds which they do by following paths that are marked with dung. Oddly enough, the hippopotamus doesn’t even use its large canines for eating at all but instead has strong lips that are used to clip the grasses and cheek teeth which then grind them up. Despite its large size, the hippopotamus only eats around 88 pounds of food a night as it uses very little energy whilst floating in the water for most of the day. In areas that are close to human settlements, hippos have also been known to invade crops consuming mainly rice plants and simply trampling over others. For a complete list of the food a hippopotamus eats, have a look at our “What Do Hippos Eat?” page!",

They are also known to consume plants that are high in salt which again means there is less competition from other animals for food. One of the most remarkable things about Camels is their ability to store the energy from their food and water as fat in their hump, which means they have a ready supply of energy when food and water are scarce. Camels can lose up to 40% of their body weight before needing to replenish themselves and once a water hole or oasis is found, they can drink around 40 gallons of water in a very short time.
